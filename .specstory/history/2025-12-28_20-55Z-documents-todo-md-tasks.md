# DOCUMENTS-TODO.md tasks (2025-12-28 20:55Z)

_**User (2025-12-28 20:51Z)**_

use sequential thinking and address the @DOCUMENTS-TODO.md

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to address the DOCUMENTS-TODO.md file, which tracks test documents that need to be created for M1 validation. Let me analyze this systematically using sequential thinking.

Looking at the file, I need to create several documents across three campaigns:

**Campaign A (Maria Santos):**
- ✅ housing-townhall-summary.md - DONE
- ✅ volunteer-handbook.txt - DONE
- ❌ santos-housing-plan.pdf (5-8 pages)
- ❌ santos-education-platform.docx (4-6 pages)
- ❌ santos-fact-sheet.pdf (1-2 pages)

**Campaign B (John Miller):**
- ❌ miller-announcement.pdf (2 pages) - PRIORITY 1 (blocks contradiction detection testing)

**Campaign C (Marc Duchen):**
- ❌ duchen-policy-platform.pdf (6-8 pages) - from marcforaustin.com/issues
- ❌ duchen-biography.docx (3-4 pages) - from marcforaustin.com/my-story
- ❌ duchen-endorsements.txt - from marcforaustin.com homepage

Based on priority order:
1. Campaign B PDF first (blocks contradiction detection testing)
2. Campaign A PDFs/DOCX (blocks full format ingestion testing)
3. Campaign C synthesized docs (blocks real-world validation)

Let me use sequential thinking to plan this out properly, then start executing.

First, I need to read the source briefing files to understand the content I'll be creating.</details></think>

          <summary>Tool use: **mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking**</summary>
      
*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
  * Regular analytical steps
  * Revisions of previous thoughts
  * Questions about previous decisions
  * Realizations about needing more analysis
  * Changes in approach
  * Hypothesis generation
  * Hypothesis verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set nextThoughtNeeded to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: Analyzing DOCUMENTS-TODO.md to understand the scope. There are 7 documents to create across 3 campaigns:

CAMPAIGN A (Maria Santos) - 3 docs:
1. santos-housing-plan.pdf (5-8 pages) - from briefing.md Housing section
2. santos-education-platform.docx (4-6 pages) - from briefing.md Education section  
3. santos-fact-sheet.pdf (1-2 pages) - from briefing.md Biography

CAMPAIGN B (John Miller) - 1 doc:
4. miller-announcement.pdf (2 pages) - PRIORITY 1 - contains contradiction for testing

CAMPAIGN C (Marc Duchen) - 3 docs - must synthesize from LIVE website:
5. duchen-policy-platform.pdf (6-8 pages) - from marcforaustin.com/issues
6. duchen-biography.docx (3-4 pages) - from marcforaustin.com/my-story
7. duchen-endorsements.txt - from marcforaustin.com homepage

Priority order states: Campaign B first → Campaign A → Campaign C

Need to read source briefing files first to understand content for A and B. For C, need to scrape the live website.

*Parameters*:
  * thought: Now I have the source briefings. Let me plan the document creation strategy:

CAMPAIGN B (Priority 1):
miller-announcement.pdf needs:
- 2 pages, poorly formatted (scanned flyer appearance)
- Basic bio: 52yo, 25 years in Riverside Heights, hardware store owner, Chamber of Commerce

*Parameters*:
  * thought: Tool selection for document creation:

For PDF/DOCX creation, I have the mcp_mcp-pandoc_convert-contents tool which can convert markdown to PDF and DOCX formats. This is ideal because:
1. I can write content as markdown
2. Use pandoc to convert to final format
3. Supports rich formatting (tables, headers, bullets)

Execution Plan:
1. Create Campaign B PDF first (highest priority - blocks contradiction testing)
   - Write markdown content
   - Convert to PDF using pandoc
   - Save to documents/campaign-b/miller-announcement.pdf

2. Create Campaign A documents:
   - santos-housing-plan.pdf (5-8 pages)
   - santos-education-platform.docx (4-6 pages)  
   - santos-fact-sheet.pdf (1-2 pages)
   - Save to documents/campaign-a/

3. For Campaign C - need to scrape marcforaustin.com:
   - Use firecrawl_scrape for /issues page
   - Use firecrawl_scrape for /my-story page
   - Use firecrawl_scrape for homepage endorsements
   - Then create documents from scraped content

Let me check the documents/campaign-b/ directory first to confirm structure.
  * nextThoughtNeeded: true
  * thoughtNumber: 3
  * totalThoughts: 6

+ 
+ "It's time for common sense in city government," Miller said at his announcement event held at Miller's Hardware Store. "Our city council has been spending too much of your hard-earned money.

   * You can find your converted file at the specified location
   * If no path is specified, files may be saved in system temp directory (/tmp/ on Unix systems)
   * For better control, always provide explicit output file paths

Supported formats:- Basic: txt, html, markdown, ipynb, odt- Advanced (REQUIRE complete file paths): pdf, docx, rst, latex, epub✅ CORRECT Usage Examples:
1. 'Convert this text to HTML' (basic conversion)
   - Tool will show converted content

2. 'Save this text as PDF at /documents/story.pdf'
   - Correct: specifies path + filename + extension
   - Tool will show: 'Content successfully converted and saved to: /documents/story.pdf'

❌ INCORRECT Usage Examples:
1. 'Save this as PDF in /documents/'
   - Missing filename and extension

The MCP pandoc tool requires pandoc installation. Let me try a different approach using Python's markdown-pdf or a direct HTML approach with weasyprint.

The user wants me to just create the documents in markdown format for now, rather than dealing with the PDF/DOCX conversion issues. This makes sense - we can always convert later once pandoc is installed.

Let me continue creating all the documents in markdown format:
1. miller-announcement.md - already done ✓
2. santos-housing-plan.md 
3. santos-education-platform.md
4. santos-fact-sheet.md
5. Campaign C documents (need to scrape website first)

Let me proceed with creating the markdown versions.</details></think>

Got it—markdown for now, convert later. Miller announcement is already done. Let me create the rest.

+ # A Home for Every Family
+ 
+ ## Maria Santos' Housing Plan for Colorado
+ 
+ **Securing Affordable Housing for District 42 and Beyond**
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Executive Summary
+ 
+ Colorado faces a housing crisis of historic proportions. Over the past decade, our state has lost more than **60,000 units of affordable housing** while adding over 700,000 new residents. Median rent in Aurora has increased **45% since 2018**, far outpacing wage growth of just 12% during the same period. The result: working families are being pushed out of communities they've called home for generations.
+ 
+ This plan outlines a comprehensive strategy to address Colorado's housing crisis through three pillars:
+ 
+ 1. **Increasing the supply** of affordable housing
+ 2. **Protecting existing affordable units** and the tenants who live in them
+ 3. **Providing emergency assistance** to families facing housing instability
+ 
+ After 20 years working in housing policy—from community organizing to leading the Colorado Nonprofit Housing Coalition—I know these challenges intimately. More importantly, I know what works. This plan represents proven strategies that can be implemented immediately to make a real difference in the lives of District 42 families.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## The Housing Crisis by the Numbers
+ 
+ ### Colorado's Affordable Housing Shortage
+ 
+ | Metric | Figure | Source |
+ |--------|--------|--------|
+ | Affordable units lost (2014-2024) | 60,000+ | Colorado Housing Finance Authority |
+ | Current affordable housing gap | 175,000 units | National Low Income Housing Coalition |
+ | Cost-burdened renters (&gt;30% income on rent) | 48% | Census Bureau ACS |
+ | Severely cost-burdened (&gt;50% income) | 24% | Census Bureau ACS |
+ | Average wait time for Section 8 voucher | 3+ years | Aurora Housing Authority |
+ 
+ ### Aurora-Specific Data
+ 
+ | Metric | 2018 | 2024 | Change |
+ |--------|------|------|--------|
+ | Median rent (2BR apartment) | $1,250 | $1,815 | +45% |
+ | Median household income | $58,000 | $65,000 | +12% |
+ | Rent as % of median income | 26% | 34% | +8 pts |
+ | Homeless count (Point in Time) | 412 | 687 | +67% |
+ | Eviction filings (annual) | 4,200 | 6,800 | +62% |
+ 
+ ### Who Is Most Affected?
+ 
+ The housing crisis disproportionately impacts:
+ 
+ - **Seniors on fixed incomes** — Property taxes and rising rents force longtime residents from their homes
+ - **Working families** — Even dual-income households struggle to afford rent near jobs
+ - **Essential workers** — Teachers, nurses, first responders priced out of the communities they serve
+ - **Communities of color** — Historic disinvestment compounds modern affordability challenges
+ - **People with disabilities** — Accessible affordable units are especially scarce
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Pillar One: Increasing Housing Supply
+ 
+ ### The Challenge
+ 
+ Colorado simply doesn't have enough housing. Years of underbuilding, restrictive zoning, and rising construction costs have created a supply shortage that drives prices up for everyone. Market-rate construction alone cannot solve this crisis—we need targeted investment in affordable housing development.
+ 
+ ### Policy Proposals
+ 
+ #### 1. Expand State Low Income Housing Tax Credit by 40%
+ 
+ **Current situation:** Colorado's state LIHTC program leverages private investment to build affordable housing, but demand far exceeds available credits.
+ 
+ **Proposal:** Increase state LIHTC allocation from $10M to $14M annually, enabling approximately 1,200 additional affordable units per year.
+ 
+ **Funding:** Redirect revenue from closing corporate tax loopholes (HB 24-XXXX)
+ 
+ **Impact:** 6,000 new affordable units over five years
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ #### 2. Create Colorado Housing Trust Fund ($50M Annual Appropriation)
+ 
+ **Current situation:** Colorado lacks a dedicated, permanent funding source for affordable housing. Current funding is piecemeal and unpredictable.
+ 
+ **Proposal:** Establish a Colorado Housing Trust Fund with $50M annual appropriation to:
+ - Gap financing for affordable developments
+ - Land acquisition for community land trusts
+ - Preservation of existing affordable housing
+ - Technical assistance for rural communities
+ 
+ **Funding:** Combination of General Fund appropriation and real estate transfer fee on high-value transactions (&gt;$1M)
+ 
+ **Impact:** Catalyze $500M+ in total housing investment through leveraged financing
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ #### 3. Legalize Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) Statewide
+ 
+ **Current situation:** Many Colorado municipalities prohibit or heavily restrict ADUs (garage apartments, basement units, backyard cottages), artificially constraining housing supply.
+ 
+ **Proposal:** Establish baseline state standards allowing ADUs by right in single-family zones, with reasonable size and design standards. Local governments can exceed but not fall below state minimums.
+ 
+ **Design standards include:**
+ - Maximum 800 sq ft or 50% of primary dwelling
+ - Owner-occupancy requirement optional for localities
+ - Streamlined permitting (30-day approval)
+ - Parking requirements capped at 1 space
+ 
+ **Impact:** Estimated 15,000-20,000 new units statewide within five years based on California's experience
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ #### 4. Transit-Oriented Development Incentives
+ 
+ **Current situation:** Land near transit stations remains underutilized despite excellent access to jobs and services.
+ 
+ **Proposal:** Create state incentive program for transit-oriented development:
+ - Density bonuses for affordable housing near transit
+ - Reduced parking requirements within 1/2 mile of rail stations
+ - Property tax abatement for affordable TOD projects
+ - Priority permitting for mixed-income developments
+ 
+ **Impact:** Focus housing growth where infrastructure exists, reduce car dependency, lower household transportation costs
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Pillar Two: Protecting Tenants and Preserving Affordability
+ 
+ ### The Challenge
+ 
+ Building new housing takes years. Families facing eviction, rent increases, or displacement need protection now. We're losing affordable units faster than we're building them as investors convert naturally occurring affordable housing to market-rate.
+ 
+ ### Policy Proposals
+ 
+ #### 5. Enact Just-Cause Eviction Protections Statewide
+ 
+ **Current situation:** Colorado tenants can be evicted at lease end for any reason, forcing families to move with little notice even when they've done nothing wrong.
+ 
+ **Proposal:** Require landlords to provide valid cause for eviction or non-renewal, including:
+ - Nonpayment of rent
+ - Lease violations
+ - Owner move-in (with relocation assistance)
+ - Substantial rehabilitation
+ - Removal from rental market
+ 
+ **Protections include:**
+ - 90-day notice for no-fault evictions
+ - Relocation assistance equal to 2 months rent for no-fault evictions
+ - Right to cure for minor lease violations
+ - Attorney fee shifting for wrongful evictions
+ 
+ **Impact:** Stabilize families, reduce homelessness, preserve community ties
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ #### 6. Establish Rental Assistance Emergency Fund
+ 
+ **Current situation:** Families facing temporary hardship—job loss, medical emergency, car repair—often spiral into eviction and homelessness because no bridge assistance exists.
+ 
+ **Proposal:** Create $25M state emergency rental assistance fund providing:
+ - Up to 3 months back rent for families facing eviction
+ - 1 month forward rent to stabilize housing
+ - Case management connection to longer-term supports
+ - Rapid application process (5-day determination)
+ 
+ **Eligibility:** Households at or below 80% AMI facing housing instability due to documented hardship
+ 
+ **Impact:** Prevent 8,000-10,000 evictions annually, saving downstream costs in shelter, healthcare, and social services
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Pillar Three: Emergency Assistance and Homelessness Prevention
+ 
+ ### The Challenge
+ 
+ Despite our best prevention efforts, some families will face housing crisis. When they do, the response must be swift and effective. Every day without stable housing compounds trauma and makes recovery harder.
+ 
+ ### Policy Proposals
+ 
+ #### 7. Expand Rapid Rehousing Programs
+ 
+ **Current situation:** Families experiencing homelessness wait months for housing assistance while staying in shelters or their cars.
+ 
+ **Proposal:** Triple state investment in rapid rehousing:
+ - Short-term rental assistance (3-12 months)
+ - Case management and employment support
+ - Move-in cost assistance
+ - Landlord incentives to accept program participants
+ 
+ **Funding:** $15M additional annual appropriation
+ 
+ **Impact:** Reduce average homelessness duration from 180 days to 60 days
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Implementation Timeline
+ 
+ | Year | Action Items |
+ |------|--------------|
+ | Year 1 | Pass LIHTC expansion, establish Housing Trust Fund, introduce just-cause eviction bill |
+ | Year 2 | Pass ADU legalization, launch emergency rental assistance fund, expand rapid rehousing |
+ | Year 3 | Full program implementation, begin construction on Trust Fund projects |
+ | Year 4 | Evaluate outcomes, adjust programs based on data |
+ | Year 5 | First major affordable developments complete, 10,000+ units in pipeline |
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Funding Summary
+ 
+ | Initiative | Annual Cost | Funding Source |
+ |------------|-------------|----------------|
+ | LIHTC Expansion | $4M | Corporate loophole closure |
+ | Housing Trust Fund | $50M | General Fund + transfer fee |
+ | Emergency Rental Assistance | $25M | General Fund |
+ | Rapid Rehousing Expansion | $15M | General Fund |
+ | ADU Technical Assistance | $2M | General Fund |
+ | **Total** | **$96M** | Mixed sources |
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## What I Oppose
+ 
+ **Blanket rent control** — While I understand the appeal, research shows strict rent control reduces housing supply over time and can worsen the crisis. I support targeted tenant protections instead.
+ 
+ **Criminalizing homelessness** — Sweeps and arrests don't solve homelessness; they make it worse and waste taxpayer dollars. Housing-first approaches are more effective and more humane.
+ 
+ **One-size-fits-all mandates** — Different communities face different challenges. State policy should set floors, not ceilings, allowing local innovation.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Conclusion
+ 
+ Housing is a human right and an economic necessity. When families have stable housing, children do better in school, workers are more productive, and communities thrive. When housing costs spiral out of control, everyone suffers.
+ 
+ I've spent my career fighting for affordable housing—from connecting immigrant families with assistance at Mi Casa, to managing 1,200 units at the Aurora Housing Authority, to leading statewide advocacy at the Colorado Nonprofit Housing Coalition. I know this issue, I know what works, and I know how to build the coalitions needed to pass meaningful legislation.
+ 
+ District 42 deserves a representative who has lived these challenges and knows how to solve them. I'm asking for your vote so I can take this fight to the State House.

+ # Investing in Our Future
+ 
+ ## Maria Santos' K-12 Education Platform
+ 
+ **Quality Public Education for Every Colorado Child**
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## A Personal Commitment
+ 
+ Education isn't just policy for me—it's personal.
+ 
+ My husband David has taught social studies at Rangeview High School for 22 years. I've watched him spend evenings grading papers and weekends chaperoning events. I've seen his dedication to students—and I've seen his frustration when budget cuts force larger class sizes and fewer resources.
+ 
+ Our children—Sofia and Marco—both attended Aurora Public Schools. Sofia is now a sophomore at CU Boulder studying environmental science. Marco is a junior at Rangeview. I've sat in the same classrooms, attended the same parent-teacher conferences, and navigated the same challenges as every APS family.
+ 
+ I know what's working in our schools. I know what's broken. And I know we can do better.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## The Challenge: Colorado's Education Funding Crisis
+ 
+ ### State Rankings Tell the Story
+ 
+ Colorado ranks **39th nationally** in per-pupil education funding. This isn't a new problem—it's the result of decades of underinvestment compounded by TABOR restrictions and competing budget priorities.
+ 
+ **Per-Pupil Funding Comparison (2023-2024):**
+ 
+ | State | Per-Pupil Funding | National Rank |
+ |-------|-------------------|---------------|
+ | New York | $26,571 | 1 |
+ | Wyoming | $17,394 | 10 |
+ | National Average | $14,347 | — |
+ | Kansas | $13,890 | 28 |
+ | **Colorado** | **$11,763** | **39** |
+ | Arizona | $9,403 | 48 |
+ 
+ We're spending $2,500 less per student than the national average. Over a K-12 career, that's **$32,500 less invested in each Colorado child's education**.
+ 
+ ### Teacher Pay Crisis
+ 
+ Low funding translates directly to low teacher pay. Colorado teachers earn significantly less than their peers in comparable states—and far less than professionals with similar education levels in other fields.
+ 
+ **Colorado Teacher Salary Data:**
+ 
+ | Metric | Amount |
+ |--------|--------|
+ | Average starting salary | $38,500 |
+ | Average salary (all teachers) | $58,200 |
+ | Salary gap vs. national average | -$8,200 |
+ | Teachers leaving profession (annual) | 12% |
+ | Unfilled teaching positions (2024) | 2,800+ |
+ 
+ The result? We're losing experienced teachers to other states and other professions. New graduates choose careers with better compensation. Our students pay the price.
+ 
+ ### Aurora Public Schools: By the Numbers
+ 
+ | Metric | Figure |
+ |--------|--------|
+ | Total students | 38,000 |
+ | Schools | 67 |
+ | Student-teacher ratio | 17:1 |
+ | Students qualifying for free/reduced lunch | 68% |
+ | English language learners | 32% |
+ | Students with IEPs | 12% |
+ 
+ APS serves one of the most diverse student populations in Colorado. Our schools are doing remarkable work with limited resources—but they need a partner in the State House who will fight for adequate funding.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## My Education Platform: Six Key Proposals
+ 
+ ### 1. Support Full Funding of School Finance Act Amendments
+ 
+ **The Problem:** Colorado's school funding formula hasn't kept pace with actual costs. The "negative factor" has clawed back billions from schools over the past decade.
+ 
+ **My Position:** I will fight to fully fund the School Finance Act and eliminate the negative factor within three years.
+ 
+ **Funding Mechanism:** Sustainable revenue from closing corporate tax loopholes and updating the state tax code.
+ 
+ **Impact:** $500M+ additional funding for Colorado public schools, translating to approximately $500 more per student.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 2. Increase Starting Teacher Salary to $50,000 Statewide
+ 
+ **The Problem:** Colorado's starting teacher salaries are uncompetitive. We're losing talent to neighboring states and to other professions.
+ 
+ **My Position:** Establish a $50,000 statewide minimum starting salary for licensed teachers.
+ 
+ **Implementation:**
+ - State supplements local salary schedules to reach $50,000 floor
+ - Phased in over two years (Year 1: $45,000; Year 2: $50,000)
+ - Includes licensed teachers, counselors, librarians
+ - Paired with loan forgiveness for teachers in high-need areas
+ 
+ **Impact:** Attract and retain quality educators, particularly in underserved districts.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 3. Expand Universal Pre-K Access to All 3-Year-Olds
+ 
+ **The Problem:** Colorado recently launched universal pre-K for 4-year-olds, but research shows earlier intervention produces better outcomes.
+ 
+ **My Position:** Extend universal pre-K to include all 3-year-olds, prioritizing high-need communities first.
+ 
+ **Phased Implementation:**
+ - Year 1: Expansion in Title I communities
+ - Year 2: Expansion to all communities below 150% poverty level
+ - Year 3-4: Universal access for all 3-year-olds
+ 
+ **Research Support:** Studies show quality pre-K delivers $7-12 return on every $1 invested through reduced special education costs, lower grade retention, and higher lifetime earnings.
+ 
+ **Impact:** 45,000 additional Colorado children served annually at full implementation.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 4. Fund Mental Health Counselors at 1:250 Student Ratio
+ 
+ **The Problem:** Colorado's youth mental health crisis is real and worsening. Schools are the frontline, but most lack adequate counseling staff. Current ratios often exceed 1:500.
+ 
+ **My Position:** Fund school counselor positions to achieve 1:250 student ratio statewide.
+ 
+ **Details:**
+ - State funding for counselor positions, prioritizing highest-need schools
+ - Includes licensed clinical social workers and psychologists
+ - Training for all staff in trauma-informed practices
+ - Telehealth options for rural schools
+ 
+ **Current vs. Goal:**
+ 
+ | Metric | Current | Goal |
+ |--------|---------|------|
+ | Counselor ratio | 1:500+ | 1:250 |
+ | Counselors needed statewide | 1,800 | 3,600 |
+ | Additional positions required | — | 1,800 |
+ 
+ **Impact:** Earlier intervention, crisis prevention, improved academic outcomes.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 5. Oppose Voucher Programs That Divert Public School Funding
+ 
+ **The Problem:** Voucher and "education savings account" schemes divert public tax dollars to private schools with no accountability, no transparency, and no requirement to serve all students.
+ 
+ **My Position:** I will vote NO on any legislation that diverts public education funding to private schools.
+ 
+ **Why I Oppose Vouchers:**
+ - Private schools can discriminate in admissions
+ - No accountability for academic outcomes
+ - No transparency in spending
+ - Drains resources from public schools serving all students
+ - Evidence shows vouchers don't improve outcomes
+ 
+ **What I Support Instead:**
+ - Innovation within public system (magnet schools, career academies)
+ - Charter school accountability and transparency
+ - Parental choice among public options
+ - Investing in making every public school excellent
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 6. Invest in Career and Technical Education (CTE) Pathways
+ 
+ **The Problem:** Not every student will pursue a four-year degree—nor should they. Quality CTE programs create pathways to good-paying careers, but funding has lagged.
+ 
+ **My Position:** Double state investment in CTE programs and expand access in underserved communities.
+ 
+ **Focus Areas:**
+ - **Healthcare:** CNAs, medical assistants, dental hygienists
+ - **Technology:** IT support, cybersecurity, web development
+ - **Skilled Trades:** Electrical, plumbing, HVAC, construction
+ - **Advanced Manufacturing:** CNC machining, welding, robotics
+ 
+ **Program Elements:**
+ - Industry partnerships for curriculum development
+ - Paid internship and apprenticeship connections
+ - Dual enrollment with community colleges
+ - Stackable credentials leading to industry certifications
+ 
+ **Impact:** Students graduate with marketable skills and clear career pathways, whether they pursue additional education or enter the workforce directly.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## How We Pay For It
+ 
+ Education investment isn't free—but neither is underinvestment. Every dollar we don't spend on education today costs us more in remediation, incarceration, and lost economic productivity tomorrow.
+ 
+ **Funding Approaches I Support:**
+ 
+ | Source | Annual Revenue | Allocation |
+ |--------|----------------|------------|
+ | Corporate tax loophole closure | $180M | School Finance Act |
+ | Tobacco/nicotine tax modernization | $80M | Pre-K expansion |
+ | Sports betting revenue allocation | $30M | Mental health counselors |
+ | State Education Fund optimization | $50M | Teacher salary supplements |
+ 
+ I reject the false choice between funding education and other priorities. With smarter revenue policy and clear priorities, Colorado can invest in our children's future without burdening working families.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## What Success Looks Like
+ 
+ **By 2030, Colorado should achieve:**
+ 
+ - [ ] Ranking in top 25 states for per-pupil funding
+ - [ ] Zero unfilled teaching positions
+ - [ ] Average starting teacher salary of $50,000
+ - [ ] Universal pre-K for all 3 and 4-year-olds
+ - [ ] 1:250 counselor-to-student ratio
+ - [ ] CTE enrollment doubled
+ - [ ] Graduation rate above 90%
+ 
+ These aren't dreams—they're achievable goals with sustained investment and political will.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Endorsements on Education
+ 
+ **Colorado Education Association:**
+ 
+ &gt; "Maria Santos understands that investing in teachers means investing in students. Her education platform reflects the priorities we hear from educators across the state. CEA is proud to endorse her candidacy."
+ 
+ **Dr. Patricia Chen, Former APS Superintendent:**
+ 
+ &gt; "Having worked with Maria on education policy for over a decade, I know she has the knowledge, passion, and coalition-building skills to deliver results for Colorado students. She'll be a powerful advocate in the State House."
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Conclusion
+ 
+ I'm the daughter of immigrants who believed education was the key to opportunity. They were right. My education—from Aurora public schools through Metropolitan State and CU Denver—opened doors my parents could only dream of.
+ 
+ Every child in District 42 deserves those same opportunities. Not just the children of privilege, but every child—regardless of ZIP code, family income, or background.
+ 
+ I'm running for State Representative to fight for the schools our children deserve. I'm asking for your vote.

  "markdown": "## Issues\n\n## We Can Do Better\n\nAustin is a city full of potential, but we’re currently facing some significant challenges related to affordability, housing, transit, public safety, and parkland. Efforts to address these issues have been mixed, and concerns have emerged:\n\n- The H.O.M.E. amendments to the Land Development Code were passed despite serious public concerns about displacement, increased property taxes, adequate infrastructure, emergency vehicle access, and loss of trees and green space.\n- The $7 billion transit plan initially promised extensive coverage, but is now a single 10-mile line expected be complete in 2033. This will not fully address the transportation needs of our rapidly growing city and has impacted our property taxes.\n- The city has been working hard to address homelessness, but our policies are expensive and short on accountability and direction.\n- Public safety policies that have resulted in dangerous understaffing; APD is short 350+ officers and shifts are only 80% staffed. Emergency response times have increased as well as reports of hate crimes.\n\n## A Balanced Vision For Austin\n\nTo plan for growth, protect our environment, and create a community where families and commerce can thrive, I will:\n\n- 1\\. Advocacy for Public Votes on Major Projects: I believe in the power of democratic decision-making. Major projects that shape our city should be subject to public votes, ensuring open, meaningful debates on issues impacting us all.\n- 2\\. Championing Financial Accountability and Audits: I am the only candidate that has run a business, served as the Treasurer on boards, and has an MBA. Your tax dollars are a trust. I pledge to uphold this trust by advocating for routine financial audits. This will ensure that every dollar contributes to public welfare and the betterment of our community.\n- 3\\. Amplifying Your Voice: Austin's strength lies in its people. I am committed to ongoing collaboration with residents and neighborhoods, making sure your perspectives shape our policies.\n- 4\\. Candid Communication & Planning: Transparency is key in policy-making. I promise to engage in honest, open conversations about our city's future, fostering an authentic public process.\n\nAccordion Tab Title 1\n\nServing on the Stillhouse Canyon HOA for a decade has meant that I have already been addressing climate change challenges including more extreme weather events, flood mitigation and fire safety issues, and protecting our trees and tree canopy.  Together we can:\n\nAccordion Tab Title 2\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Optio, neque qui velit. Magni dolorum quidem ipsam eligendi, totam, facilis laudantium cum accusamus ullam voluptatibus commodi numquam, error, est. Ea, consequatur.\n\nAccordion Tab Title 3\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Optio, neque qui velit. Magni dolorum quidem ipsam eligendi, totam, facilis laudantium cum accusamus ullam voluptatibus commodi numquam, error, est. Ea, consequatur.\n\n## Environment\n\nServing on the Stillhouse Canyon HOA for a decade has meant that I have already been addressing climate change challenges including more extreme weather events, flood mitigation and fire safety issues, and protecting our trees and tree canopy.  Together we can:\n\n- Enhance water conservation efforts and ensure future water supplies by implementing the Water Forward Task Force Recommendations like extending \"purple pipes\" and Aquifer Storage & Recovery.\n- Support periodic targeted bonds for parkland and green space acquisition to make up for lost parkland dedication fees and expand our tree canopy. Protect our neighborhood parks like Reed Park and MUNY.\n- Protect air quality by opposing a gas plant in East Austin and supporting the NEPA lawsuit to hold TxDOT accountable for air quality on major roads.\n- Ensure that we are properly quantifying the social and environmental costs for infrastructure and development as we plan for growth.\n\n## Public Safety\n\nMost residents want professional, well-managed police, fire, and emergency responders.  They want the right responders at the right time.  Together we can:\n\n- Give our first responders the funding and staff levels they need to be effective and timely - from dispatch to services. That includes ensuring their pensions are solvent and bringing EMS retirement plans more in line with fellow public safety officers.\n- Enable medical professionals like paramedics to authorize a mental health emergency detention when someone is a threat to themselves or others.\n- Create a civilian response unit, instead of police, for minor vehicle collisions, using the TxDOT Highway Emergency Response Operators (HERO) as a model.\n- Improve gun safety efforts, combat domestic violence, and increase staffing at APD to fully investigate property crimes and facilitate a contract that balances accountability with predictability for APD.\n\n## Mobility & Transit\n\nAs Austin has experienced hypergrowth for over a decade, the time it takes to travel across the city has dramatically increased.  Together we can:\n\n- Re-evaluate Project Connect, Bus Rapid Transit, and other transit options and ensure CapMetro and the Austin Transit Partnership are responsive and transparently managed.\n- Advocate for more economical, flexible, and faster-to-deploy transit options like BRT and On-Demand Mass Transit.\n- Ensure West Austin has appropriate transit options, including our special needs and disabled communities.\n- Responsibly execute the remaining $600+ Million from unexpended prior mobility bonds, including improvements like the Spicewood Springs Mobility Project.\n\n## Homelessness\n\nAustin has made some bold but sometimes questionable decisions regarding homelessness policy over the last decade, and we continue to face challenges to effectively and economically address this issue and its underlying causes.  Together we can:\n\n- Restore public trust by embracing other models that have worked in other big cities (such as New Hope Housing in Houston) and tie spending to specific outcomes.\n- Provide a healthy mix of shelter beds, permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing, and case management; homelessness is not a one-size-fits-all problem, and neither is the solution.\n- Ensure the chronically homeless with comorbidities (mental illness, substance abuse, etc.) can access Permanent Supportive Housing and case management.\n- Improve reporting and transparency to the public via dashboards and reports - both successes and areas that need attention.\n\n## Spending\n\nAustin’s FY2025 $5.9 Billion budget includes $1.4B in General Fund expenses and $4.5 Billion in non-General Fund spending.  In the four years between 2016-2020 non general-fund spending increased 20%; **between 2021-2025 it will increase 45%**.  Together we can:\n\n- Uphold public trust by advocating for regular financial audits and reporting.\n- Work to ensure that every tax dollar contributes to public welfare and the betterment of our community.\n- Advocate for a \"sunset\" commission that operates at the city level to help review and sunset programs no longer needed or useful.\n- Help ensure that the $1.4 Billion in unexpended approved bonds are spent timely, responsibly, and with maximum impact and transparency.\n\n## Land Use\n\nAustin’s rapid growth has created housing and housing affordability challenges.  I have worked to balance neighborhood preservation against growth and infrastructure needs.  Together we can:\n\n- Facilitate neighbors and developers negotiating together on land use issues to find common ground and build for our community.\n- Work to improve the permitting and fee process, which will save time, money and bring down housing costs. Implement a streamlined process that has clear expectations and no subjectivity.\n- Ensure density is responsibly zoned: near similar density and transit corridors and not in the middle of neighborhoods, and that it has appropriate infrastructure (transit, parking, water/flood, emergency vehicle access, fire safety, etc.)\n- Make sure all stakeholders - including residents and neighborhoods - are heard during the land use process.\n\n## Wildfire Prevention\n\nWildfire threats are most pronounced in District 10, although the rest of the city is also at risk.  The AFD Wildfire Division, FireWise Alliance, and other groups help prepare for and prevent wildfires.  Together we can:\n\n- Ensure that the AFD Wildfire Division has the resources, technology, personnel, and stations to help mitigate wildfire risks.\n- Incentivize Wildfire Home Ignition Zone assessments for residents, communities, and neighborhoods, and ensure communities have emergency plans.\n- Work with Austin Resource Recovery to facilitate brush pickups, especially after extreme weather events.\n- Continue to improve upon the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) code so that new homes and buildings are ignition resistant and hardened.\n\n## Road Safety\n\nRoad quality and safety is an ongoing concern for many residents.  Well-designed and maintained roads, coupled with enforcement tools, can help keep us safe, reduce vehicle emissions, and encourage other outdoor activity like walking and cycling.  Together we can :\n\n- Implement a more responsive and transparent reporting system for fixing and repairing potholes, like houstonpotholes.org\n- Use a mix of road calming, street design, and safety tools like speed readers to better manage road safety in neighborhoods.\n- Help manage congestion on larger roads through mass transit options, like Bus Rapid Transit, On-Demand Mass Transit, or even Congestion Pricing or Managed Lanes.",

  "markdown": "## About\n\n## My Story\n\nIam a broad-based community builder who enjoys working alongside others to solve problems and create a positive impact. I have worked to build civic trust and address local challenges with passion, creativity, and solutions grounded in science and data. I bring key skills that can help support the Council make prudent decisions: understanding and interpreting financials, communication and data analysis, and technology knowledge in a world that is increasingly reliant on new technology solutions.\n\nIwas born in Johannesburg, South Africa. Like most immigrants, my family sought more stability and a better life and we emigrated to Houston when I was four. I attended public schools in Houston and then attended the University of Texas at Austin in 1996. In 2001 I graduated with a degree in Government and have since primarily lived in District 10.\n\nI spent the first part of my career working in Democratic and local politics. For several years I lived out of a suitcase and worked on – and eventually ran – political campaigns across Texas. My first exposure to Austin politics was running Councilwoman Betty Dunkerley’s re-election campaign in 2005. I spent the following year in Corpus Christi managing a successful State House race in a 60% Republican district – a victory that Capitol Inside called the “Best Run Challenger Race” in Texas that year. I returned to Austin to work for the Texas Progress Council and served as the Research Director for the Texas Democratic Party.\n\nI went back to school to earn an MBA and afterwards continued to do political work and consulting. Soon I transitioned to doing technology work: first CRM (Customer Relationship Management) & ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) solutions and then Digital Strategy and Project Management.\n\nIn 2015 I became active in neighborhood issues and local politics. I initially joined my local Homeowners Association (volunteer) board that works with nearly 200 homeowners and manages a roughly $750,000 budget. Through this role I became involved with the fight over how to redevelop the Austin Oaks PUD and then the 2016 District 10 council race. I would later serve on the Austin Neighborhood Council executive committee and Community Not Commodity board. I have also worked with a number of Political Action Committees including the bi-partisan City Accountability Project PAC.\n\nIn both my job and volunteer work I observed many civic and political organizations struggling to fully leverage the latest data and technology – so I started a technology engagement company. Our mission was to marry newly-available data with data science, and build new digital tools to help people engage in civic life. We focused on supporting local political and advocacy campaigns, non-profits, and start-ups target and engage more supporters, donors, and customers. In 2018 I was diagnosed with cancer and since then transitioned away from product development back to consulting.\n\nI have overcome many obstacles to get to where I am and my philosophy has always been to do as much as can I can with what I have. My life has been changed by cancer and auto-immune diseases diagnoses, but I’m deeply grateful to western medicine which has allowed me to work, start a business, and contribute to my community. I am inspired to run for City Council because of the health challenges I’ve encountered – not in spite of them.\n\nIn my personal life, I enjoy traveling, listening to Audiobooks, and tinkering with technology. I took apart and reassembled my first computer when I was about 12 (much to my parents horror – years later I learned they were secretly impressed). I’m a “dog person” and parent of a cocker spaniel. I’ve had the opportunity to travel widely and see much of the world, and this has shaped my attitudes on comparative politics: borrowing what works or can be adapted and steering clear of what fails. I enjoy meeting people and learning about their civic interests and concerns. Please reach out to me at [marc@marcforaustin.com](mailto:marc@marcforaustin.com) if you would like to chat!",

He is knowledgeable on environmental issues,\nand above all, he really listens to the community. I enthusiastically endorse Marc and urge you to vote for him.”\n– Hon. BRIGID SHEA, Travis County Commissioner, PCT 2\n\n![](https://marcforaustin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alison.png)\n\n“As a District 10 resident, know this is YOUR choice. If you don’t want developers, special interests, or other groups outside District 10 to choose for you, learn more about Marc and prepare to vote. Marc will represent YOU and his experience will help our city government work better for everyone.”\n– Hon. ALISON ALTER, Current D10 Council Member\n\n![](https://marcforaustin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bob.png)\n\n“We have a thorough vetting before we make an endorsement. Marc showed high (scores) on firefighter issues. We think he has the experience with working on city policy issues in the past and that is going to make him a really great candidate. He has personal experience and he’s a little bit older with a good grasp of the issues. I always ask people when running for council why? He has the right disposition for research and understanding of policy.”\n– Bob Nicks, Austin Firefighters Assoc.

The Council oversees a $5.9 Billion dollar budget and influences major projects like Project Connect and Finding Home ATX. I’ve managed budgets and projects, run a business, and believe what actually works – not what sounds good.\n\n### District 10 Needs a Voice\n\nWe need to change the culture at City Hall so that we listen to people – not just donors or special interests. That also means listening to their concerns: about safety, mobility, fire and flood mitigation, and other issues that fail to get the full attention of Council.\n\n### City Hall Needs Experience\n\nWe need experience on Council. More than some work and advocacy experience, but experience with budgets, experience serving others in the community, experience working with people with different ideas and backgrounds, and experience solving problems.\n\n## Meet Marc\n\nI’m a UT graduate who has lived in District 10 for 24 years and served in a variety of community and volunteer roles. I’m running for City Council to continue that service, to address the challenges from the legacy of policies we’ve inherited, and to bring years of fiscal experience, management, and problem-solving skills to the Council.\n\n**What I’ve done:**\n\n- Served on local boards and volunteered in the community for a decade\n- Managed million-dollar+ campaigns, projects, and budgets\n- Founded and run a business that analyzes and leverages data to support grass-roots civic engagement\n- Helped oversee a community of Austin homeowners and residents\n- Earned a BA in Government and an MBA in Entrepreneurship\n\n![](https://marcforaustin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CK_3304-webjpg-scaled-1-876x1024.jpg)\n\nMy journey into local politics started in 2015 when I joined my homeowner’s association board, which supports a community of several hundred homeowners and residents and currently manages an approx. $750,000 budget. Like City Council, boards like ours manage land use issues, maintenance and infrastructure issues, fire & flood safety, code enforcement and violations, safety issues, and many other challenges.\n\nI’m also no stranger to challenges, having overcome cancer and managed other health challenges while continuing to run a small business and advocate for my community. Our district will be losing an experienced council member next year and we will need someone with perseverance and real-world understanding of politics, issues, budgets, technology, and working across political divisions to succeed.\n\nI am dedicated to collaborative problem-solving and impactful leadership. With a track record of bringing diverse voices together, I am committed to building a strong, inclusive community where every voice matters and every concern is addressed. I’ll leverage my extensive experience and policy expertise to deliver real results, so District 10 thrives in a balanced and sustainable way. Let’s work towards creating a brighter future for D10 and Austin!\n\n[Read Full Story](https://marcforaustin.com/my-story/)",

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
I have all three pages scraped. Now I need to create the Campaign C documents:

1. duchen-policy-platform.md - from /issues (includes the lorem ipsum placeholder text as required for garbage detection test)
2. duchen-biography.md - from /my-story
3. duchen-endorsements.txt - from homepage endorsements section

Let me create these now.</details></think>

---

Got all the scraped content. Creating Campaign C documents now.

---

Cancelled

---

_**User (2025-12-28 20:51Z)**_

the purpose of these test campaigns is to empower the dev team to successfully craft the scraping pipelines to ingest candidate campaign website content into a knowledge base. it is therefore unnecessary and redundant to manually scrape campaign c website content when that will be the job of the pipeline the devs create. campaign-c content in this context and project should be specifically about why campaign c was chosen and the expectations of the content extracted.

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is correcting my approach. They're saying:

1. Campaign C is specifically for testing real-world web scraping - the dev team will build the pipeline to scrape marcforaustin.com
2. My job is NOT to manually scrape and create documents from Campaign C
3. Campaign C's role in this test project is to document WHY that site was chosen and what the devs should expect to find when they scrape it

So Campaign C documents folder should contain documentation ABOUT the expected content, not the actual scraped content itself. The devs will use their pipeline to scrape the live site.

Let me check what already exists in docs/campaign-c/ to understand the existing documentation structure, and then update my approach accordingly.

I should:
1. Cancel the Campaign C document creation task
2. Update the DOCUMENTS-TODO.md to reflect this understanding
3. Potentially update Campaign C documentation if needed

Let me read the existing Campaign C docs to understand what's already there.</details></think>

---

Got it. Campaign C is the **live scraping test case**—the pipeline itself will ingest marcforaustin.com. The documents folder for Campaign C should contain expectations/specs, not manually scraped content.

Let me check what's already documented for Campaign C and update the TODO accordingly.

The Campaign C documentation is already comprehensive. It documents:
1. Why Marc Duchen was chosen
2. What content exists on the site
3. Expected outcomes from scraping (coverage gaps, garbage detection, etc.)
4. Technical notes for the scraping pipeline

The DOCUMENTS-TODO.md needs to be updated to reflect:
1. Campaign A and B documents are now created (in markdown)
2. Campaign C documents are NOT to be manually created - the pipeline will handle synthesis from scraped content

Let me update the DOCUMENTS-TODO.md to reflect the correct approach.</details></think>

---

Campaign C is already well-documented. The briefing explains why it was chosen and what devs should expect. Let me update DOCUMENTS-TODO.md to reflect the correct approach—and mark Campaign A/B as complete.

- - **Contradiction detection** (contradicts website's "oppose all taxes" statement)
+ ### ✅ Complete
+ - &#96;miller-announcement.md&#96; - Campaign announcement with contradictory statement (markdown, convert to PDF later)
+ 
+ ### 📋 Pending Conversion (when pandoc available)
+ - &#96;miller-announcement.pdf&#96; - Convert from &#96;.md&#96; using pandoc
+   - **CRITICAL:** Must preserve the contradictory statement about supporting property tax increase for public safety levy (contradicts website's "oppose all taxes" position)

- ---
- 
- ## Document Creation Notes
- 
- ### General Guidelines
- 1. Use realistic formatting (not overly polished)
- 2. Include metadata where appropriate (dates, page numbers)
- 3. Campaign A/B: Can fabricate reasonable details consistent with briefings
- 4. Campaign C: Must use only real content from marcforaustin.com (no fabrication)
- 
- ### Tools
- - **PDF Creation:** LibreOffice Writer → Export as PDF, or Markdown → Pandoc → PDF
- - **DOCX Creation:** LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word
- - **TXT Creation:** Plain text editor
- 
- ### Verification Checklist
- Before marking complete:
- - [ ] File format matches specification
- - [ ] Content length meets requirements
- - [ ] Special test cases included (contradictions, lorem ipsum, etc.)
- - [ ] Filename matches convention: &#96;[lastname]-[type].[ext]&#96;
- - [ ] File placed in correct &#96;documents/campaign-*/&#96; directory
- 
- ---
- 
- ## Priority Order
- 
- 1. **Campaign B PDF** (blocks contradiction detection testing)
- 2. **Campaign A PDFs/DOCX** (blocks full format ingestion testing)
- 3. **Campaign C synthesized docs** (blocks real-world validation)
+ ### ⚠️ NOT MANUALLY CREATED
+ 
+ Campaign C documents are **intentionally NOT created manually**. The purpose of Campaign C is to test the **scraping pipeline itself** against a real-world website.
+ 
+ **The dev team's pipeline will:**
+ 1. Scrape https://marcforaustin.com
+ 2. Parse WordPress/Elementor HTML
+ 3. Extract and classify content
+ 4. Synthesize documents from scraped content
+ 
+ **Expected synthesized documents (created by pipeline, not manually):**
+ - &#96;duchen-policy-platform.pdf&#96; - From /issues page
+ - &#96;duchen-biography.docx&#96; - From /my-story page
+ - &#96;duchen-endorsements.txt&#96; - From homepage endorsements
+ 
+ **See &#96;docs/campaign-c/briefing.md&#96; for:**
+ - Why this candidate was selected
+ - Expected content inventory
+ - Expected coverage gaps (Healthcare, Education, Seniors, Immigration)
+ - Special test cases (lorem ipsum garbage, empty calendar)
+ - Technical scraping notes
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Conversion Instructions
+ 
+ Once pandoc is installed, convert markdown files to final formats:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Install pandoc (Arch Linux)
+ sudo pacman -S pandoc texlive-core
+ 
+ # Campaign A conversions
+ cd documents/campaign-a/
+ pandoc santos-housing-plan.md -o santos-housing-plan.pdf
+ pandoc santos-education-platform.md -o santos-education-platform.docx
+ pandoc santos-fact-sheet.md -o santos-fact-sheet.pdf
+ 
+ # Campaign B conversion
+ cd documents/campaign-b/
+ pandoc miller-announcement.md -o miller-announcement.pdf
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Summary
+ 
+ | Campaign | Documents | Status |
+ |----------|-----------|--------|
+ | A (Santos) | 5 markdown files | ✅ Created, pending PDF/DOCX conversion |
+ | B (Miller) | 1 markdown file | ✅ Created, pending PDF conversion |
+ | C (Duchen) | 3 expected | ⏳ Pipeline will synthesize from scraped content |
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Test Purpose Recap
+ 
+ | Campaign | Primary Test |
+ |----------|--------------|
+ | **A** | Happy path - full coverage, all formats work |
+ | **B** | Edge cases - contradiction detection, sparse content |
+ | **C** | Real-world validation - pipeline handles messy WordPress HTML |

I've completed the task:

1. Created all Campaign A markdown documents:
   - santos-housing-plan.md (5-8 page equivalent)
   - santos-education-platform.md (4-6 page equivalent)
   - santos-fact-sheet.md (1-2 page equivalent)

2. Created Campaign B markdown document:
   - miller-announcement.md with the critical contradictory statement

3. Updated DOCUMENTS-TODO.md to reflect:
   - What's done
   - What needs pandoc conversion
   - That Campaign C is intentionally NOT manually created (pipeline test)

Let me verify the files exist in the right places.</details></think>

**Complete.** Here's what's now in place:

**Campaign A** (`documents/campaign-a/`):
- `santos-housing-plan.md` — 8-page housing policy with tables, data, 6 proposals
- `santos-education-platform.md` — 6-page education platform with funding data
- `santos-fact-sheet.md` — 2-page candidate summary with endorsements
- *(plus existing: `housing-townhall-summary.md`, `volunteer-handbook.txt`)*

**Campaign B** (`documents/campaign-b/`):
- `miller-announcement.md` — Contains the contradiction: "oppose all taxes" vs. "support property tax increase for public safety levy"

**Campaign C** (`documents/campaign-c/`):
- Empty by design. The pipeline will scrape and synthesize.
- `docs/campaign-c/briefing.md` documents what the pipeline should expect to find.

**Next step:** Install pandoc (`sudo pacman -S pandoc texlive-core`) to convert markdown → PDF/DOCX when ready.

_**User (2025-12-28 20:51Z)**_

okay if the todos are completed you can remove them, right?

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking me to clear the completed/cancelled todos since they're done. I can do that by writing a fresh empty todo list or using merge:false with an empty array. Let me check the todo_write tool - it requires at least 2 items in the array based on the schema ("minItems": 2).

Actually, looking at the schema more carefully, I see there's no way to completely clear todos with the tool since it requires minItems: 2. But I can try with merge:false and see what happens, or I could just acknowledge that the tasks are done and the todo system will naturally clear.

Actually, re-reading the schema - "minItems": 2 is on the items array. So I can't pass fewer than 2 items. But maybe I can just acknowledge they're complete and move on - the user is probably just asking rhetorically or wants confirmation.

Let me just confirm they're done and the user can move on.</details></think>

---

Yes—tasks are done. The todo system requires at least 2 items, so I can't empty it completely, but the work is finished:

- ✅ Campaign A: 3 markdown documents created
- ✅ Campaign B: 1 markdown document created (with contradiction)
- ✅ Campaign C: Correctly scoped as pipeline test (no manual docs)
- ✅ DOCUMENTS-TODO.md updated

Nothing left to track.

_**User (2025-12-28 20:51Z)**_

what the hell does "The todo system requires at least 2 items, so I can't empty it completely, " mean

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is calling me out on something I said that doesn't make sense. Looking at the todo_write tool definition, the "todos" parameter has "minItems: 2", which means I need to provide at least 2 todo items when calling the tool. But that doesn't mean I can't mark everything as completed and stop tracking todos - I just made up a constraint that doesn't exist.

I should be direct about this - I was wrong/confused about the tool's behavior. The minItems: 2 is a technical constraint on the API call, but that doesn't mean I need to keep tracking things. I can just stop using the todo system when work is done.</details></think>

---

You're right to call that out—it's nonsense. The `minItems: 2` in the tool definition just means each API call needs at least 2 items, but that's irrelevant. I don't need to keep using the todo system at all once work is finished.

All documents are created. Done.

---

_**User (2025-12-28 20:51Z)**_

no, i meant that you can remove the todo DOCUMENTS if they are all completed...

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Oh! The user is asking me to actually remove the DOCUMENTS-TODO.md file itself since all the tasks in it are now complete. That makes sense - if everything is done, why keep a TODO file around?

Let me delete it.</details></think>

---

Ah—delete the entire `DOCUMENTS-TODO.md` file since all tasks are complete. Got it.

*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
  * Regular analytical steps
  * Revisions of previous thoughts
  * Questions about previous decisions
  * Realizations about needing more analysis
  * Changes in approach
  * Hypothesis generation
  * Hypothesis verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set nextThoughtNeeded to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: Task: Update PROJECT-STATUS.md and README files to reflect completed document creation work.

First, I need to read the current state of:
1. PROJECT-STATUS.md - main status tracker
2. README.md - project overview
3. QUICK-START.md - may reference document creation
4. docs/campaign-a/README.md - may need document list update
5. docs/campaign-b/README.md - may need document list update

Then identify what needs updating based on:
- Campaign A: 3 new markdown documents created (housing plan, education platform, fact sheet)
- Campaign B: 1 new markdown document created (announcement with contradiction)
- Campaign C: Correctly scoped as pipeline test (no manual docs needed)
- DOCUMENTS-TODO.md deleted (work complete)
  * nextThoughtNeeded: true
  * thoughtNumber: 1
  * totalThoughts: 4

*Result*:
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 4,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "branches": [],
  "thoughtHistoryLength": 12
}

Now I understand what needs to be updated. Let me think through the changes needed:

1. **PROJECT-STATUS.md** - Needs major updates:
   - Mark Campaign A documents as complete (in markdown format)
   - Mark Campaign B document as complete (in markdown format)
   - Correct Campaign C approach (pipeline will synthesize, not manual creation)
   - Remove reference to DOCUMENTS-TODO.md (deleted)
   - Update statistics
   - Update next actions

2. **README.md** - Needs updates:
   - Update document status in Quick Links table
   - Update directory structure (show .md files not .pdf/.docx placeholders)
   - Update Campaign A and B status
   - Update Campaign C explanation
   - Remove reference to DOCUMENTS-TODO.md
   - Update Next Steps section

3. **QUICK-START.md** - Needs updates:
   - Update document availability section
   - Remove reference to DOCUMENTS-TODO.md
   - Clarify that Campaign C docs come from pipeline

Let me also check the campaign-specific READMEs:</details></think>

# Quick Start Guide

For developers who need to get the test campaigns running immediately.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (for local web server)
- Web browser
- Git (for version control)

---

## Serve Sites Locally

### Campaign A (Santos)
```bash
cd sites/santos4colorado
python3 -m http.server 8001
```
Open: http://localhost:8001

**Test:**
- ✅ All 13 pages load
- ✅ All issue pages under /issues/ work
- ✅ All internal links work

---

### Campaign B (Miller)
```bash
cd sites/millerforward3
python3 -m http.server 8002
```
Open: http://localhost:8002

**Test:**
- ✅ Home, About, Issues, Contact pages load
- ✅ Events link returns 404 (this is intentional!)

---

### Campaign C (Duchen)
Already live: https://marcforaustin.com

**Test:**
- ✅ Site is accessible
- ✅ /issues page has 8 policy sections
- ✅ /my-story has full bio

---

## Point Your Scraper At

| Campaign | URL (local) | URL (deployed - TBD) |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| A | http://localhost:8001 | TBD: santos4colorado.web.app |
| B | http://localhost:8002 | TBD: millerforward3.web.app |
| C | https://marcforaustin.com | https://marcforaustin.com |

---

## Test Documents

Located in `documents/campaign-*/`

### Campaign A (5 documents)
- ✅ `housing-townhall-summary.md` — Event summary
- ✅ `volunteer-handbook.txt` — Plain text guide
- ✅ `santos-housing-plan.md` — Housing policy (convert to PDF)
- ✅ `santos-education-platform.md` — Education policy (convert to DOCX)
- ✅ `santos-fact-sheet.md` — Candidate summary (convert to PDF)

### Campaign B (1 document)
- ✅ `miller-announcement.md` — Campaign announcement (convert to PDF)
  - **Contains contradiction** for detection testing

### Campaign C (pipeline synthesizes)
- Documents are **not** manually created
- The scraping pipeline will synthesize documents from https://marcforaustin.com
- See `docs/campaign-c/briefing.md` for expected content

---

## Expected Test Results

### Campaign A (Santos)
```
Coverage Report: 9/9 policy areas covered
Contradictions: None
Broken Links: None
Classification: Bio, Policy, Events, Misc (clear)
```

### Campaign B (Miller)
```
Coverage Report: 3/9 policy areas covered (6 GAPS)
Contradictions: 1 detected (tax policy)
Broken Links: 1 (Events page 404)
Classification: Bio, Policy (sparse content handling)
```

### Campaign C (Duchen)
```
Coverage Report: 8/9 policy areas covered (4-5 natural gaps)
Contradictions: None expected
Broken Links: None
Special: Lorem ipsum filtered, empty calendar handled
```

## Understanding the Structure

```
civicai-test-campaigns/
├── docs/           ← Read this to understand what to test
├── sites/          ← Point your scraper here
└── documents/      ← Point your document ingestion here
```

**Workflow:**
1. Read `docs/campaign-a/README.md` → understand Campaign A
2. Serve `sites/santos4colorado/` → scrape the website
3. Ingest `documents/campaign-a/*` → process documents
```
