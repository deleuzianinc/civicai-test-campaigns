            <h2>Where I Stand</h2>
            <p>I'm focused on the issues that matter most to Ward 3 families.</p>
        </div>
        
        <section class="issue">
            <h2>Fiscal Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Government needs to live within its means, just like families and businesses do. I will oppose any new taxes or fee increases. Period. Riverside families are taxed enough.</p>
            
            <p>I'll conduct a line-by-line audit of the city budget to find waste and inefficiency. We can reduce the city workforce through natural attrition—when someone retires, we don't automatically fill that position. We ask: is this position necessary?</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="issue">
            <h2>Public Safety</h2>
            <p>I support our brave men and women in uniform. Our police officers put their lives on the line every day, and they deserve our support—not criticism.</p>
            
            <p>I'll fight for more officers on the street, especially downtown. I oppose any attempts to defund or reduce funding for our police department.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="issue">
            <h2>Economic Development</h2>
            <p>As a small business owner for 26 years, I know what it takes to create jobs and meet a payroll. We need to cut the red tape that's strangling local businesses.</p>
            
            <p>I'll work to attract new employers to Riverside Heights and support downtown revitalization. A strong local economy means more jobs and opportunities for Ward 3 families.</p>
