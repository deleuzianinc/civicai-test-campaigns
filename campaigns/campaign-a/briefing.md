## Biography

**Personal Background:**

Maria Elena Santos, 47, is a lifelong Coloradan raised in Aurora by immigrant parents from Mexico. Her father worked as a carpenter for 35 years; her mother was a home health aide. Maria is married to David Santos, a high school teacher, and they have two children: Sofia (19), a sophomore at CU Boulder studying environmental science, and Marco (16), a junior at Rangeview High School.

Maria grew up in a working-class household where her parents worked multiple jobs to provide opportunities. She was the first in her family to attend college, graduating from Metropolitan State University Denver with a degree in Public Administration (2000) and later earning her Master's in Public Policy from the University of Colorado Denver (2008).

She is active in her local Catholic parish, coaches youth soccer, and volunteers with Habitat for Humanity. She lives in the same Aurora neighborhood where she grew up, in a home she and David purchased in 2006.

**Professional Background:**

Maria has 20+ years of public service experience:

- **Current Role (2018-Present):** Executive Director, Colorado Nonprofit Housing Coalition—leads statewide advocacy for affordable housing, manages $2.4M annual budget, coordinates 45 member organizations
- **2012-2018:** Deputy Director, Aurora Housing Authority—oversaw 1,200 affordable housing units, managed $8M annual budget, led energy efficiency retrofits saving $340K annually
- **2005-2012:** Policy Analyst, Colorado Department of Local Affairs—researched housing policy, drafted legislation, testified before state legislature
- **2000-2005:** Community Organizer, Mi Casa Resource Center—connected immigrant families with housing assistance, job training, and education programs

**Why Running:**

"After 20 years of working within the system to help families find stable housing and economic opportunity, I've seen firsthand how state policy either opens doors or creates barriers. Our district is at a crossroads—housing costs are pushing out longtime residents, our schools need investment, and working families are one emergency away from crisis. I'm running because I know how to write effective policy, build coalitions, and deliver results. District 42 deserves a representative who understands their daily struggles because I've lived them."

## Policy Positions

### Housing & Affordability

**Position:** Expand affordable housing supply and protect renters from displacement through strategic investment and policy reform.

**Key Points:**
- Increase state Low Income Housing Tax Credit allocation by 40%
- Create Colorado Housing Trust Fund with $50M annual appropriation
- Enact just-cause eviction protections statewide
- Support accessory dwelling unit (ADU) legalization in single-family zones
- Establish rental assistance emergency fund for families facing eviction
- Incentivize employer-assisted housing programs through tax credits

**Detailed Stance:**

Colorado has lost over 60,000 affordable housing units in the past decade. Median rent in Aurora increased 45% since 2018 while wages grew only 12%. Maria will fight for a comprehensive housing strategy that builds new units, preserves existing affordable stock, and protects tenants from predatory practices. She opposes blanket rent control but supports targeted tenant protections and robust investment in supply-side solutions.

---

### Education (K-12)

**Position:** Fully fund public schools, support teachers, and ensure every student has access to quality education regardless of ZIP code.

**Key Points:**
- Support full funding of School Finance Act amendments
- Increase starting teacher salary to $50,000 statewide
- Expand universal pre-K access to all 3-year-olds
- Fund mental health counselors at 1:250 student ratio
- Oppose voucher programs that divert public school funding
- Invest in career and technical education (CTE) pathways

**Detailed Stance:**

Maria's children attended Aurora Public Schools, and her husband has taught in the district for 22 years. She knows the challenges: overcrowded classrooms, underpaid teachers, and students who need more support than the system can provide. Colorado ranks 39th nationally in per-pupil funding. Maria will fight to move us into the top 25 within five years through sustainable revenue solutions and efficient resource allocation.

---

### Healthcare Access

**Position:** Lower healthcare costs, protect reproductive rights, and expand mental health services.

**Key Points:**
- Support Colorado Option public insurance plan
- Cap insulin prices at $50/month (expand current law coverage)
- Codify abortion rights in state law
- Expand Medicaid reimbursement rates to increase provider participation
- Fund community health centers in underserved areas
- Create behavioral health crisis response teams as alternative to police

**Detailed Stance:**

Healthcare costs are the #1 driver of personal bankruptcy in Colorado. Maria believes healthcare is a right, not a privilege. She'll fight to expand the Colorado Option, ensure reproductive healthcare remains accessible and legal, and address the mental health crisis affecting our youth. She supports market-based reforms alongside public options—a pragmatic approach that delivers results.

---

### Economy & Jobs

**Position:** Build an economy that works for working families through workforce development, small business support, and fair wages.

**Key Points:**
- Support gradual minimum wage increase to $18/hour by 2028
- Expand apprenticeship programs in construction, healthcare, and technology
- Create small business grant fund ($25M) for historically underserved entrepreneurs
- Support paid family and medical leave expansion
- Invest in broadband infrastructure for rural and underserved areas
- Protect gig workers through portable benefits legislation

**Detailed Stance:**

Our economy should reward work, not just wealth. Maria's parents worked multiple jobs their entire lives and still struggled. She'll fight for policies that create pathways to middle-class stability: apprenticeships that lead to good-paying careers, small business support for entrepreneurs in communities that lack access to capital, and labor standards that ensure work pays enough to live on.

---

### Environment & Climate

**Position:** Accelerate Colorado's clean energy transition while protecting workers and communities dependent on fossil fuel industries.

**Key Points:**
- Support 100% clean electricity by 2040
- Expand electric vehicle tax credits and charging infrastructure
- Protect public lands from drilling and mining expansion
- Fund just transition programs for displaced fossil fuel workers
- Strengthen air quality standards in Front Range ozone non-attainment areas
- Support environmental justice legislation prioritizing frontline communities

**Detailed Stance:**

Climate change is real, it's urgent, and Colorado is already feeling its effects through wildfires, drought, and extreme weather. But we can't abandon the workers and communities built around traditional energy. Maria supports an aggressive but just transition—one that creates clean energy jobs while providing real support for displaced workers. She opposes greenwashing and performative environmentalism; she wants policy that actually reduces emissions.

---

### Public Safety & Criminal Justice

**Position:** Invest in community-based safety strategies and reform a criminal justice system that too often fails victims and over-punishes minor offenses.

**Key Points:**
- Fund violence intervention programs proven to reduce gun violence
- Support police accountability through independent oversight boards
- Expand mental health response alternatives to armed police response
- Reform cash bail to eliminate wealth-based detention
- Increase victim services funding
- Support sentence reform for nonviolent drug offenses

**Detailed Stance:**

Maria believes in both safety and justice. Her brother struggled with addiction and spent years cycling through an incarceration system that did nothing to help him recover. He's now 8 years sober and works as a peer counselor. Maria knows that public safety requires more than policing—it requires investment in prevention, intervention, and opportunity. She opposes defunding police but supports reimagining public safety to include community-based responses.

---

### Infrastructure & Transportation

**Position:** Invest in modern, sustainable infrastructure that connects communities and creates good-paying jobs.

**Key Points:**
- Support RTD expansion to underserved Aurora corridors
- Fund road maintenance backlog through dedicated revenue
- Invest in pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure
- Expand electric vehicle charging network along I-70 corridor
- Support affordable transit passes for low-income residents
- Prioritize infrastructure projects that reduce air pollution

**Detailed Stance:**

District 42 residents spend too much time stuck in traffic, and many lack reliable transit options to reach jobs. Infrastructure investment is economic development—it creates construction jobs today and improves productivity tomorrow. Maria will fight for transit equity: ensuring that working-class communities have the same access to mobility as wealthier areas.

---

### Seniors & Aging

**Position:** Ensure Colorado seniors can age with dignity through housing security, healthcare access, and protection from exploitation.

**Key Points:**
- Expand property tax relief for seniors on fixed incomes
- Fund senior center expansion and programming
- Support in-home care alternatives to institutional placement
- Strengthen elder abuse prevention and prosecution
- Protect senior housing from conversion to market-rate units
- Support intergenerational housing models

**Detailed Stance:**

Maria's work in housing taught her that seniors are among the most vulnerable to displacement. Fixed incomes can't keep pace with rising rents and property taxes. She'll fight to ensure that seniors who built this community can remain here, in their homes, with the support they need to live independently.

---

### Immigration

**Position:** Colorado should welcome immigrants and protect immigrant communities from federal overreach while maintaining local law enforcement focus on public safety.

**Key Points:**
- Maintain Colorado's sanctuary policies protecting local law enforcement from immigration enforcement duties
- Expand state-funded legal aid for immigrants facing deportation
- Support driver's licenses for all residents regardless of immigration status
- Protect DACA recipients and advocate for federal pathway to citizenship
- Fund immigrant integration programs (English language, civics, job training)
- Oppose employer exploitation of undocumented workers

**Detailed Stance:**

Maria is the daughter of immigrants. Her parents came to Colorado seeking opportunity and found it. They paid taxes, raised a family, and contributed to their community. Maria will fight to protect immigrant families from discrimination and deportation while advocating for comprehensive federal immigration reform. She believes local police should focus on public safety, not federal immigration enforcement.
