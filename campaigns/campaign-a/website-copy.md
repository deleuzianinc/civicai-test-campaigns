## Quick Pitch Section

**Headline:**  
A Voice for Working Families

**Body:**  
I'm Maria Santos — a lifelong Coloradan, daughter of immigrants, housing advocate, and your neighbor. For two decades, I've worked alongside families struggling to find affordable homes, parents fighting for better schools, and workers demanding fair wages.

District 42 deserves a representative who understands your daily struggles — because I've lived them. My parents worked multiple jobs their whole lives. I was the first in my family to go to college. I raised my kids in Aurora public schools. And I've seen firsthand how state policy can open doors or slam them shut.

It's time for change. It's time for a representative who will fight for *you*.

## Personal Story Section

**Headline:**  
My Story

**Body:**  
I grew up in Aurora, the daughter of Mexican immigrants who came to Colorado searching for opportunity. My father worked as a carpenter for 35 years. My mother was a home health aide. They worked multiple jobs, long hours, and sacrificed everything to give me and my siblings a chance at a better life.

We didn't have much, but we had community. Our neighbors looked out for each other. When someone struggled, we showed up. That's the Colorado I grew up in — and it's the Colorado I'm fighting to protect.

I was the first person in my family to go to college. I earned my degree in Public Administration from Metro State and later my Master's in Public Policy from CU Denver. Education changed my life, and I've spent my career working to make sure others have the same opportunities.

Today, I live in the same Aurora neighborhood where I grew up, in a home my husband David and I purchased in 2006. David has taught high school for 22 years. Our daughter Sofia is studying environmental science at CU Boulder. Our son Marco is a junior at Rangeview High. Both our kids went through Aurora Public Schools.

I'm running for State Representative because I believe in this community. I believe in our future. And I know that with the right leadership, we can build a Colorado where everyone — not just the wealthy — can thrive.

## Family Section

**Headline:**  
My Family

[Image: Santos family photo]

**Body:**  
My husband David and I have been married for 23 years. He's a high school history teacher who's spent his career shaping young minds in Aurora Public Schools. Our daughter Sofia, 19, is a sophomore at CU Boulder studying environmental science — she's determined to tackle climate change. Our son Marco, 16, is a junior at Rangeview High, where he plays on the soccer team.

Our family is rooted in this community. We worship at our local Catholic parish, volunteer with Habitat for Humanity, and never miss a Rangeview soccer game. District 42 isn't just my district — it's my home.

## Why I'm Running Section

**Headline:**  
Why I'm Running

**Body:**  
> "After 20 years of working within the system to help families find stable housing and economic opportunity, I've seen firsthand how state policy either opens doors or creates barriers. Our district is at a crossroads — housing costs are pushing out longtime residents, our schools need investment, and working families are one emergency away from crisis. I'm running because I know how to write effective policy, build coalitions, and deliver results. District 42 deserves a representative who understands their daily struggles because I've lived them."

---

## Values Section

**Headline:**  
What I Believe

**Community First**  
Every decision I make will put working families first — not special interests, not wealthy donors, not political games.

**Pragmatic Progress**  
I believe in solutions that work. Not ideology for its own sake. Not performative politics. Real policy that makes real differences.

**Bridge Building**  
The best solutions come from listening — to neighbors, experts, and even those who disagree. I'll work across lines to get things done.

# ISSUE PAGE — Housing & Affordability

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Housing & Affordability

**Subhead:**  
Expanding affordable housing and protecting renters from displacement

[Image: Aurora neighborhood streetscape]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Colorado has lost over 60,000 affordable housing units in the past decade. Median rent in Aurora increased 45% since 2018 while wages grew only 12%. Working families are being pushed out of communities they've called home for generations.

**My Position:**  
I will fight to expand affordable housing supply and protect renters from displacement through strategic investment and policy reform.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Increase state Low Income Housing Tax Credit allocation by 40%** — Build more affordable units faster
- **Create Colorado Housing Trust Fund with $50M annual appropriation** — Dedicated, sustainable funding for housing programs
- **Enact just-cause eviction protections statewide** — No one should lose their home without legitimate reason
- **Legalize accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in single-family zones** — Create more housing options in existing neighborhoods
- **Establish rental assistance emergency fund** — Help families facing eviction stay housed
- **Incentivize employer-assisted housing through tax credits** — Partner with businesses to house workers

---

## My Approach

Housing is deeply personal to me. It's been my life's work.

At the Colorado Nonprofit Housing Coalition, I've spent six years fighting for policies that keep families housed. At the Aurora Housing Authority, I managed 1,200 affordable units and saw firsthand how stable housing transforms lives. As a community organizer at Mi Casa, I helped immigrant families navigate the housing system.

I know this issue from every angle — policy, management, and the human side. And I know what works: invest in supply, protect tenants, and provide emergency support when families face crisis.

I oppose blanket rent control because evidence shows it can reduce housing supply over time. Instead, I support targeted tenant protections — like just-cause eviction — combined with aggressive investment in building new affordable units. We need both: protection for today and more homes for tomorrow.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you're a renter:** You deserve security. You shouldn't face eviction without cause or watch your rent spike 30% overnight. I'll fight for protections that keep you housed.

**If you're a homeowner:** You've invested in this community. I'll protect your investment while supporting responsible growth that maintains neighborhood character.

**If you're priced out:** You shouldn't have to leave the community where you work, worship, and raise your family. I'll fight for affordable options so you can stay.

# ISSUE PAGE — Education

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Education

**Subhead:**  
Fully funding public schools and supporting the teachers who shape our future

[Image: Students in classroom]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Colorado ranks 39th nationally in per-pupil funding. Starting teacher salaries can't compete with neighboring states. Our schools are asked to do more with less while students face increasing challenges.

**My Position:**  
I will fight for full funding of public schools, fair pay for teachers, and ensuring every student has access to quality education regardless of ZIP code.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Support full funding of School Finance Act amendments** — Close the funding gap that shortchanges our kids
- **Increase starting teacher salary to $50,000 statewide** — Recruit and retain the best educators
- **Expand universal pre-K to all 3-year-olds** — Give every child a strong start
- **Fund mental health counselors at 1:250 student ratio** — Support student wellbeing
- **Oppose voucher programs** — Keep public dollars in public schools
- **Invest in career and technical education (CTE)** — Multiple pathways to success

---

## My Approach

This issue is personal. My kids — Sofia and Marco — attended Aurora Public Schools. My husband David has taught in APS for 22 years. I've seen the challenges from inside the system: overcrowded classrooms, burned-out teachers, students who need more support than the system can provide.

Education changed my life. I was a first-generation college student. Without public schools that believed in me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

Colorado has fallen behind, and our kids are paying the price. We've underinvested for decades, and teachers are leaving for states that pay better. This isn't sustainable.

I'll fight to move Colorado from 39th to the top 25 in per-pupil funding within five years. This requires sustainable revenue solutions and efficient resource allocation — not just promises, but a real plan.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you're a parent:** Your child deserves a great education, no matter which school they attend. I'll fight for the funding and support to make that happen.

**If you're a teacher:** You deserve fair pay and respect for the critical work you do. I'll fight for salaries that reflect your value.

**If you're a student:** You deserve support — academic, emotional, and practical. I'll fight for mental health services, career pathways, and schools that see your potential.

# ISSUE PAGE — Healthcare

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Healthcare Access

**Subhead:**  
Lowering costs, protecting reproductive rights, and expanding mental health services

[Image: Community health clinic]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Healthcare costs are the #1 driver of personal bankruptcy in Colorado. Mental health services are scarce. And reproductive rights face constant threats.

**My Position:**  
Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. I will fight to lower costs, protect reproductive freedom, and expand access to care for all Coloradans.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Support Colorado Option public insurance plan** — A public option to drive down costs
- **Cap insulin at $50/month** — Expand current law to cover more Coloradans
- **Codify abortion rights in state law** — Protect reproductive healthcare from federal attacks
- **Expand Medicaid reimbursement rates** — Ensure providers can afford to serve Medicaid patients
- **Fund community health centers** — Bring care to underserved areas
- **Create behavioral health crisis response teams** — Mental health professionals, not just police

---

## My Approach

No one should go bankrupt because they got sick. No one should ration insulin because they can't afford it. And no one should be told what healthcare decisions they can make for their own body.

I support a pragmatic approach: market-based reforms alongside public options. The Colorado Option creates competition that drives down prices. Expanded Medicaid keeps working families covered. Community health centers bring care where it's needed most.

On reproductive rights, I'm unequivocal: abortion is healthcare, and healthcare decisions belong to patients and doctors — not politicians. I'll fight to codify abortion rights in state law so they can never be taken away.

And on mental health: we're in a crisis, especially among young people. Schools need counselors. Communities need crisis response teams that can de-escalate without armed police. We need to treat mental health with the same urgency we treat physical health.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you're struggling with costs:** I'll fight for a public option that gives you affordable choices, and for caps on prices for essential medications.

**If you need mental health support:** I'll fight for expanded services, school counselors, and crisis response alternatives.

**If you value reproductive freedom:** I'll fight to protect your right to make your own healthcare decisions.

# ISSUE PAGE — Economy & Jobs

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Economy & Jobs

**Subhead:**  
Building an economy that works for working families

[Image: Workers at local business]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Wages haven't kept pace with costs. Small businesses struggle to compete. Workers in the gig economy lack basic protections. The economy is growing, but not everyone is benefiting.

**My Position:**  
I will fight for an economy that rewards work — through fair wages, workforce development, and support for small businesses and entrepreneurs.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Support gradual minimum wage increase to $18/hour by 2028** — Ensure work pays enough to live on
- **Expand apprenticeship programs** — Construction, healthcare, and technology pathways to good careers
- **Create $25M small business grant fund** — Support entrepreneurs in underserved communities
- **Support paid family and medical leave expansion** — Care for family without losing your job
- **Invest in broadband infrastructure** — Connect rural and underserved areas
- **Protect gig workers** — Portable benefits for the modern economy

---

## My Approach

My parents worked multiple jobs their entire lives and still struggled. That's wrong. Work should pay enough to live on.

I believe in an economy that creates pathways to middle-class stability. Not everyone needs a four-year degree — but everyone deserves access to training that leads to good-paying careers. Apprenticeship programs in construction, healthcare, and technology can transform lives.

Small businesses are the backbone of our communities, but too many entrepreneurs in historically underserved neighborhoods lack access to capital. A targeted grant fund can unlock opportunity for business owners who've been left behind.

And we need to catch up to the modern economy. Gig workers deserve protections. Remote work requires broadband. Paid leave means you shouldn't have to choose between caring for your family and keeping your job.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you're working paycheck to paycheck:** I'll fight for wages that keep pace with costs and benefits that provide real security.

**If you're building a business:** I'll fight for access to capital and support for small business owners.

**If you're looking for opportunity:** I'll fight for training pathways that lead to good-paying careers.

# ISSUE PAGE — Environment & Climate

**Headline:**  
Environment & Climate

**Subhead:**  
Accelerating clean energy while protecting workers and communities

[Image: Colorado mountain landscape / solar panels]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Climate change is real and urgent. Colorado faces wildfires, drought, and extreme weather. But the transition to clean energy must be just — we can't abandon workers and communities built around traditional energy.

**My Position:**  
I will fight for aggressive climate action with a just transition — creating clean energy jobs while supporting displaced workers.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Support 100% clean electricity by 2040** — Lead the nation in clean energy
- **Expand electric vehicle tax credits and charging infrastructure** — Make EVs accessible
- **Protect public lands from drilling and mining expansion** — Preserve Colorado's natural heritage
- **Fund just transition programs** — Real support for displaced fossil fuel workers
- **Strengthen Front Range air quality standards** — Clean air for frontline communities
- **Support environmental justice legislation** — Prioritize communities bearing pollution's burden

---

## My Approach

I reject false choices. We can have a strong economy AND a healthy planet. We can transition to clean energy AND protect workers whose livelihoods depend on traditional industries.

Climate change is here. Wildfires have devastated Colorado communities. Drought threatens our water supply. The Front Range faces dangerous ozone levels. We need action — real policy that actually reduces emissions, not performative gestures.

But I also understand that transition is hard. Workers in coal country didn't create climate change, and they shouldn't bear the burden of solving it. Just transition means real retraining, real support, and real jobs in the new energy economy.

And environmental justice means recognizing that pollution doesn't affect everyone equally. Frontline communities — often low-income, often communities of color — bear the heaviest burden. They deserve a voice in environmental policy.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you care about the planet:** I'll fight for aggressive climate action and clean energy leadership.

**If you work in traditional energy:** I'll fight for a just transition with real support — not empty promises.

**If you live in a frontline community:** I'll fight for clean air, clean water, and a voice in the decisions that affect you.

# ISSUE PAGE — Public Safety

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Public Safety & Criminal Justice

**Subhead:**  
Investing in community safety and reforming a broken system

[Image: Community gathering / neighborhood watch]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Our criminal justice system too often fails victims and over-punishes minor offenses. Meanwhile, gun violence devastates communities. We need a smarter approach to public safety.

**My Position:**  
I believe in both safety AND justice. I will fight for community-based safety strategies and criminal justice reforms that actually work.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Fund violence intervention programs** — Evidence-based approaches that reduce gun violence
- **Support independent police oversight boards** — Accountability builds trust
- **Expand mental health crisis response** — Not every crisis needs an armed response
- **Reform cash bail** — End wealth-based detention
- **Increase victim services funding** — Support survivors, not just punishment
- **Reform sentences for nonviolent drug offenses** — Treatment, not incarceration

---

## My Approach

This issue is personal. My brother struggled with addiction for years. He cycled through an incarceration system that did nothing to help him recover — it just trapped him in a loop of arrest, jail, release, relapse. Today, he's 8 years sober and works as a peer counselor helping others. He got better *despite* the system, not because of it.

I believe in public safety — real safety, not just tough talk. That means investing in prevention, intervention, and opportunity. It means police who are accountable to the communities they serve. It means mental health crisis teams that can de-escalate without guns. It means treating addiction as a health issue, not a crime.

I don't support defunding police. But I do support reimagining public safety to include more than just armed response. When someone is having a mental health crisis, we need trained professionals, not just officers. When violence threatens a neighborhood, we need intervention programs that actually work.

And victims deserve better too. More funding for survivor services. More support for healing. A system that centers justice for those who've been harmed.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you want safer communities:** I'll fight for evidence-based approaches that actually reduce violence.

**If you want accountability:** I'll fight for independent oversight and police reforms that build trust.

**If you've been impacted by the system:** I'll fight for reforms that treat people with dignity and focus on healing.

# ISSUE PAGE — Infrastructure & Transportation

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Infrastructure & Transportation

**Subhead:**  
Investing in modern infrastructure that connects communities

[Image: RTD train / road construction]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
District 42 residents spend too much time stuck in traffic, and many lack reliable transit options. Roads need maintenance. Pedestrian infrastructure is lacking. Working-class communities often get left behind.

**My Position:**  
I will fight for infrastructure investment that creates jobs today and improves mobility tomorrow — with transit equity for all communities.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Support RTD expansion to underserved Aurora corridors** — Transit for everyone, not just wealthy areas
- **Fund road maintenance backlog** — Fix what we have before building new
- **Invest in pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure** — Safe streets for all users
- **Expand EV charging network along I-70 corridor** — Support clean transportation
- **Affordable transit passes for low-income residents** — Cost shouldn't be a barrier to mobility
- **Prioritize projects that reduce air pollution** — Infrastructure that protects health

---

## My Approach

Infrastructure is economic development. Construction jobs today, improved productivity tomorrow, and a better quality of life for everyone.

But infrastructure investment hasn't always been fair. Wealthy communities get great transit service while working-class neighborhoods get passed over. That's not right.

Transit equity means ensuring that everyone — not just those who can afford it — has access to reliable transportation. It means affordable passes so cost isn't a barrier. It means service to underserved corridors, not just downtown routes.

And it means fixing what we have. Our roads need maintenance. Our bridges need repair. Before we build new mega-projects, let's take care of the infrastructure we already have.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you commute:** I'll fight for transit options that get you where you need to go, reliably and affordably.

**If you drive:** I'll fight for road maintenance and reduced congestion.

**If you walk or bike:** I'll fight for safe infrastructure that protects all road users.

# ISSUE PAGE — Seniors & Aging

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Seniors & Aging

**Subhead:**  
Ensuring Colorado seniors can age with dignity

[Image: Seniors at community center]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Seniors on fixed incomes can't keep pace with rising property taxes and rents. Many lack access to quality care. Too many face isolation or exploitation.

**My Position:**  
I will fight to ensure that seniors who built this community can remain here, in their homes, with the support they need to live independently.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Expand property tax relief for seniors on fixed incomes** — Stay in the home you worked for
- **Fund senior center expansion and programming** — Combat isolation with community
- **Support in-home care alternatives** — Age at home, not in institutions
- **Strengthen elder abuse prevention and prosecution** — Protect the vulnerable
- **Protect senior housing from market-rate conversion** — Keep affordable options available
- **Support intergenerational housing models** — Innovation in housing solutions

---

## My Approach

My work in housing taught me that seniors are among the most vulnerable to displacement. You worked your whole life, paid off your home, planned for retirement — and then property taxes spike and you can't afford to stay. That's wrong.

Seniors deserve security. They deserve to age in their homes, in their communities, surrounded by the people they love. That means property tax relief so fixed incomes can keep pace. It means funding for in-home care so people can stay out of institutions. It means protecting existing senior housing from conversion to market-rate.

And it means community. Senior centers aren't just nice-to-haves — they're lifelines that combat isolation and keep people connected. We need to invest in programming that keeps seniors engaged, healthy, and part of community life.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you're approaching retirement:** I'll fight for policies that protect your ability to stay in your home and community.

**If you're caring for aging parents:** I'll fight for support services and in-home care options that ease the burden.

**If you're a senior now:** I'll fight for your security, your dignity, and your voice in the decisions that affect you.

**Subhead:**  
Welcoming immigrants and protecting families from discrimination

[Image: Diverse community gathering]

---

## Position Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Immigrant families live in fear of federal overreach. Local resources are strained. And too many politicians scapegoat immigrants instead of solving problems.

**My Position:**  
Colorado should welcome immigrants and protect immigrant communities. Local police should focus on public safety, not federal immigration enforcement.

---

## Key Priorities

- **Maintain Colorado's sanctuary policies** — Local police focus on local public safety
- **Expand state-funded legal aid** — Help immigrants facing deportation navigate the system
- **Support driver's licenses for all residents** — Safety on the roads, regardless of status
- **Protect DACA recipients** — Advocate for federal pathway to citizenship
- **Fund immigrant integration programs** — English, civics, job training
- **Oppose employer exploitation** — Protect undocumented workers from abuse

---

## My Approach

I'm the daughter of immigrants. My parents came to Colorado seeking opportunity, and they found it. They worked hard, paid taxes, raised a family, and contributed to their community for 40 years.

That's the immigrant story. Not the fear-mongering you hear from politicians looking for scapegoats.

I'll fight to protect immigrant families from discrimination and deportation. Local police should focus on public safety — keeping all residents safe — not doing the federal government's enforcement work. Sanctuary policies make communities safer because they mean immigrants will report crimes and cooperate with police.

And I'll advocate for comprehensive federal immigration reform. Congress has failed to act for decades. We need a real pathway to citizenship for people who've been contributing to our communities for years.

---

## What It Means For You

**If you're an immigrant:** I'll fight for your protection, your dignity, and your place in this community.

**If you're a DACA recipient:** I'll fight for your security and advocate for a permanent solution.

**If you believe in fairness:** I'll fight against scapegoating and for policies based on facts, not fear.
