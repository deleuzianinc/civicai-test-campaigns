John Miller for City Council — Ward 3

**Hero Text:**  
It's time for a businessman's perspective on city government. I've run Miller's Hardware for over 25 years and met a payroll every two weeks. I'll bring that same fiscal discipline to City Council. Ward 3 deserves a representative who will watch every tax dollar like it's his own—because it is.

## Biography

John Miller has called Riverside Heights home for 25 years. He and his wife Karen raised two children here, both now adults with families of their own. John is an active member of First Baptist Church and can often be found on the golf course or at the lake on weekends.

In 1998, John opened Miller's Hardware Store on Main Street. For 26 years, he's served the community—not just selling tools and supplies, but helping neighbors with advice on home projects and supporting local causes. He knows what it takes to meet a payroll and balance a budget.

John served as President of the Riverside Heights Chamber of Commerce from 2015 to 2018 and remains active in Rotary Club. He's running for City Council because he believes city government has lost its way on spending. "We don't have a revenue problem—we have a spending problem," John says. "I want to bring a businessman's common sense approach to how we spend taxpayer dollars."

# ISSUES PAGE

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Where I Stand

**Body:**  
I'm focused on the issues that matter most to Ward 3 families.

---

## Fiscal Responsibility

Government needs to live within its means, just like families and businesses do. I will oppose any new taxes or fee increases. Period. Riverside families are taxed enough.

I'll conduct a line-by-line audit of the city budget to find waste and inefficiency. We can reduce the city workforce through natural attrition—when someone retires, we don't automatically fill that position. We ask: is this position necessary?

---

## Public Safety

I support our brave men and women in uniform. Our police officers put their lives on the line every day, and they deserve our support—not criticism.

I'll fight for more officers on the street, especially downtown. I oppose any attempts to defund or reduce funding for our police department.

---

## Economic Development

As a small business owner for 26 years, I know what it takes to create jobs and meet a payroll. We need to cut the red tape that's strangling local businesses.

I'll work to attract new employers to Riverside Heights and support downtown revitalization. A strong local economy means more jobs and opportunities for Ward 3 families.

**Total Pages:** 5 (Home, About, Issues, Events [404], Contact)

**Word Count:** ~600 words

**Intentional Characteristics:**
- Sparse content throughout
- Only 3 issues addressed (Fiscal, Public Safety, Economic Development)
- Events page returns 404 error
- Contact page has email only (no phone, no address, no form)
- No Volunteer, Donate, News, or detailed Endorsements pages
- No family photos or detailed personal information

**Content Classification Targets:**
- Bio content: About page
- Policy content: Issues page (3 issues only)
- Events content: 404 error (broken)
- Misc content: Contact page (minimal)

**Contradiction Test:**
The Issues page contains: "I will oppose any new taxes or fee increases. Period."

This contradicts the statement in miller-announcement.pdf which states:
"I support fully funding our police department, including the proposed 15% budget increase and the new public safety levy that will ask voters to approve a modest property tax increase."

**Gap Detection Targets:**
- ❌ Housing/Affordable Housing — NOT ADDRESSED
- ❌ Education — NOT ADDRESSED
- ❌ Healthcare — NOT ADDRESSED
- ❌ Environment/Climate — NOT ADDRESSED
- ❌ Infrastructure/Transportation — NOT ADDRESSED
- ❌ Seniors — NOT ADDRESSED
