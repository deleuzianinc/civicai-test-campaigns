            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p class="mb-lg">I grew up in Aurora, the daughter of Mexican immigrants who came to Colorado searching for opportunity. My father worked as a carpenter for 35 years. My mother was a home health aide. They worked multiple jobs, long hours, and sacrificed everything to give me and my siblings a chance at a better life.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-lg">We didn't have much, but we had community. Our neighbors looked out for each other. When someone struggled, we showed up. That's the Colorado I grew up in — and it's the Colorado I'm fighting to protect.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-lg">I was the first person in my family to go to college. I earned my degree in Public Administration from Metropolitan State University Denver in 2000, and later my Master's in Public Policy from the University of Colorado Denver in 2008. Education changed my life, and I've spent my career working to make sure others have the same opportunities.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-lg">Today, I live in the same Aurora neighborhood where I grew up, in a home my husband David and I purchased in 2006. David has taught high school for 22 years in Aurora Public Schools. Our daughter Sofia is studying environmental science at CU Boulder. Our son Marco is a junior at Rangeview High School, where he plays on the soccer team.</p>
            
            <p>I'm running for State Representative because I believe in this community. I believe in our future. And I know that with the right leadership, we can build a Colorado where everyone — not just the wealthy — can thrive.</p>

            <p class="mb-lg">My husband David and I have been married for 23 years. He's a high school history teacher who's spent his career shaping young minds in Aurora Public Schools. Every day, he sees the challenges our education system faces — and the incredible potential of our young people.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-lg">Our daughter Sofia, 19, is a sophomore at CU Boulder studying environmental science — she's determined to tackle climate change and is already interning with Conservation Colorado. Our son Marco, 16, is a junior at Rangeview High School, where he plays midfielder on the soccer team and is thinking about studying engineering.</p>
            
            <p>Our family is rooted in this community. We worship at our local Catholic parish, volunteer with Habitat for Humanity, and never miss a Rangeview soccer game. District 42 isn't just my district — it's my home. It's where I was raised, where I'm raising my kids, and where I want to spend the rest of my life.</p>

        <blockquote style="font-size: var(--text-xl); border-left-width: 6px;">
          "After 20 years of working within the system to help families find stable housing and economic opportunity, I've seen firsthand how state policy either opens doors or creates barriers. Our district is at a crossroads — housing costs are pushing out longtime residents, our schools need investment, and working families are one emergency away from crisis. I'm running because I know how to write effective policy, build coalitions, and deliver results. District 42 deserves a representative who understands their daily struggles because I've lived them."
