        <section>
            <p>John Miller has called Riverside Heights home for 25 years. He and his wife Karen raised two children here, both now adults with families of their own. John is an active member of First Baptist Church and can often be found on the golf course or at the lake on weekends.</p>
            
            <p>In 1998, John opened Miller's Hardware Store on Main Street. For 26 years, he's served the community—not just selling tools and supplies, but helping neighbors with advice on home projects and supporting local causes. He knows what it takes to meet a payroll and balance a budget.</p>
            
            <p>John served as President of the Riverside Heights Chamber of Commerce from 2015 to 2018 and remains active in Rotary Club. He's running for City Council because he believes city government has lost its way on spending. "We don't have a revenue problem—we have a spending problem," John says. "I want to bring a businessman's common sense approach to how we spend taxpayer dollars."</p>
