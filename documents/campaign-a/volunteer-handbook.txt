FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=================================================================

Q: I've never volunteered on a campaign before. Is that okay?
A: Absolutely. Most of our volunteers have no prior campaign experience. We provide full training and pair new volunteers with experienced ones during their first shifts.

Q: I have a disability. Can I still volunteer?
A: Yes. We're committed to accessibility. Phone banking can be done entirely remotely. Office support roles are wheelchair accessible. If you need accommodations, contact volunteer@mariasantosforsenate.org and we'll work with you.

Q: I don't speak English fluently. Can I help?
A: Yes! We need volunteers who speak Spanish, Vietnamese, and other languages to reach voters in their preferred language. Contact us about bilingual canvassing and phone banking opportunities.

Q: What if someone asks me a question I can't answer?
A: You're not expected to be a policy expert. We provide reference sheets with Maria's positions on key issues. If you don't know an answer, say so honestly and offer to have someone from the campaign follow up. Collect their contact info and pass it to your coordinator.

Q: Can I bring my kids to volunteer activities?
A: It depends on the activity. Kids are welcome at many events and some office shifts. Canvassing and phone banking are generally not suitable for young children. Contact your coordinator in advance to confirm.

Q: What if I need to cancel a shift?
A: We understand that life happens. Please notify your coordinator at least 24 hours in advance so we can fill the slot. Repeated last-minute cancellations may affect future scheduling.

Q: How do I request a yard sign or campaign materials for myself?
A: Email volunteer@mariasantosforsenate.org or pick up materials during your shift at HQ. Please don't take materials intended for voter outreach without asking.

Q: I have a great idea for the campaign. Who do I tell?
A: We love hearing from volunteers! Share ideas with your coordinator or email ideas@mariasantosforsenate.org. While we can't implement every suggestion, we review all feedback.

Q: What happens after the election?
A: If Maria wins, you'll be invited to the victory celebration and will have opportunities to stay engaged with her legislative work. If we don't win, you'll have gained valuable organizing skills and connections in the local political community. Either way, thank you for being part of this movement.
