RIVERSIDE HEIGHTS — John R. Miller, longtime local businessman and former Chamber of Commerce President, today announced his candidacy for City Council representing Ward 3.

"It's time for common sense in city government," Miller said at his announcement event held at Miller's Hardware Store. "Our city council has been spending too much of your hard-earned money.

### Miller Pledges Support for Police

*August 20, 2024 Update*

In a follow-up statement, Miller announced his strong support for local law enforcement and public safety funding.

"Our police officers put their lives on the line every day to keep Riverside Heights safe," Miller said. "I support fully funding our police department, including the proposed 15% budget increase and the new public safety levy that will ask voters to approve a modest property tax increase. Public safety is worth paying for."

Miller emphasized that backing law enforcement is a top priority for his campaign. "We need more officers on the street, not fewer. I'll oppose any attempts to defund our police department."
